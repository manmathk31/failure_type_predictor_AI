## üîç Overview

The `failure_type_predictor_AI` is a machine learning model designed to predict the **type of failure** a machine might encounter before it actually happens. This helps industries reduce unplanned downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and save operational costs. The model uses sensor readings and machine-specific data to forecast potential issues.

## üìä Problem Statement

In manufacturing and industrial settings, machines often fail due to various reasons. The objective of this project is to classify **different types of machine failures** using historical data collected from IoT-enabled sensors. This classification aids in taking proactive measures to prevent major breakdowns.
